# LYRA_Simple_Wallet

This is the nonofficial LYRA GUI ( Graphic User Interface ) very easy to use developed in QT for windows users ( at this moment ).

The wallet will download and install all dependencies necessary to run ( .NET Core & LYRA CLI wallet ).

#### Usage:

Download the archive and checksum file from https://github.com/MorgothCreator/LYRA_Simple_Wallet/tree/master/Releases veryfy the integrity of the erchive with Gpg4win downloaded from https://www.gpg4win.org ( or other pgp utility ) and extract the archive wherever you want.

Open the directory and double click on lyra_win_wallet_v0.1.0.exe, If you do not have .NET Core installed on your PC the GUI it will download and prompt you for install, if the LYRA CLI 1.7.8.0 archive does not exist in the root of the GUI, will download the 1.7.8.0 version and extract all necessary commponents in the same directory under lyra directory, all components from lyra directory will be refreshed every time you open the GUI.

When all components are downloaded and extracted the GUI will open prompting to enter a wallet name if you already have one, if you do not have one click cancel.

Now from menu you can create a wallet, recover one from private key, load an already existing one, send, receive LYR coins, the GUI does not synchronize automatically, the user need to click on sync button when necessary.

When you change networks, if a wallet was oppened at the moment of change, the oppened walled will be closed.

There is a debug window that can be oppened any time and see the responses given by the CLI, the debug window will be deleted only when you close the GUI interface..
